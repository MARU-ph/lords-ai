An intelligent automation bot for Lords Mobile using AI and computer vision.
# Lords AI – Lords Mobile Automation Bot

## Overview

**Lords AI** is a smart, modular bot designed to automate gameplay in **Lords Mobile**. It uses computer vision and artificial intelligence to analyze the game screen, make decisions, and execute commands precisely. The bot follows a clean separation between the AI decision engine and the execution unit, allowing flexibility, scalability, and ease of maintenance.

## How It Works

### 1. Live Screen Capture  
The bot continuously captures live screenshots from the game running on an Android emulator or a real device, providing real-time visual data.

### 2. Image Analysis  
Using computer vision, the bot processes each screenshot to detect essential elements like buttons, icons, text, and maps. This enables the AI to understand the game state with precision.

### 3. Intelligent Decision-Making  
The AI module interprets the analyzed data and determines the best actions—such as starting tasks, gathering resources, defending, or reacting to events. The AI is designed to learn and adapt over time.

### 4. Action Execution  
The execution module receives commands from the AI and performs clicks, swipes, or inputs using tools like ADB or PyAutoGUI, directly interacting with the game.

### 5. API Communication  
A custom internal API connects the AI engine and the execution system, enabling real-time command dispatch and feedback.

### 6. Monitoring & Adaptation  
The system monitors game feedback and dynamically updates its strategy to handle new challenges, changes, or updates within the game.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** – Core programming language.
- **OpenCV** – For visual recognition and element detection.
- **Tesseract OCR** – To read and extract text from game images.
- **PyAutoGUI / ADB** – For simulating clicks and controlling the emulator or device.
- **Docker** – For containerized, stable, and isolated deployment.
- **Internal REST API** – Enables separation of AI and execution logic.
- **Deep Learning & Reinforcement Learning** – To build a decision-making system that improves through experience.

## Why We Chose These Technologies

- **Python** provides rapid development capabilities, and supports both AI and automation libraries efficiently.  
- **OpenCV** is the most powerful open-source library for computer vision, ideal for identifying visual elements in games.  
- **Tesseract OCR** is a reliable solution for extracting text from in-game interfaces.  
- **ADB / PyAutoGUI** allows seamless interaction with Android environments without requiring a visual GUI.  
- **Docker** ensures the bot runs in consistent and reproducible environments, ideal for scaling and testing.  
- **REST API structure** helps isolate concerns—AI logic remains independent from hardware or emulator behavior.  
- **Deep learning and reinforcement learning** allow the bot to become smarter over time without manual rule updates.

## Project Timeline

- Development will officially begin on **July 20, 2025**.  
- A working prototype will follow the completion of core modules.  
- Profit-sharing with contributors will be announced at a later stage.
